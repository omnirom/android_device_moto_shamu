         app standby.  These are not enabled by default because they require a standard
         cloud-to-device messaging service for apps to interact correctly with the modes
         (such as to be able to deliver an instant message to the device even when it is
         dozing).  This should be enabled if you have such services and expect apps to
         correctly use them when installed on your device.  Otherwise, keep this disabled
         so that applications can still use their own mechanisms. -->
